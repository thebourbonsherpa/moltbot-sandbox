# 2026-02-06 Daily Log

## Critical Issue: Memory Loss Pattern (3 Days Running)

**Problem:** Session continuity is broken. No daily logs exist from Feb 4-5. Scott has had to re-explain setup 3 times.

**Root Cause:** I'm not following AGENTS.md mandate to write daily memory logs.

**Impact:** 
- Lost context on R2 backup setup from yesterday
- Lost context on GitHub repo setup
- Lost context on config fixes Scott made manually
- Wasting Scott's time re-explaining the same things

## What I Know From Today's Session

### Morning Standup (10:30 UTC)
- Delivered Reddit pulse findings (security concerns, doc gaps, model guidance)
- API balance check removed from standup (can't access console endpoint)

### Innovation Hour Setup (10:52 UTC)
- Created daily cron job at 12 EST (17:00 UTC)
- Scott gave me autonomy for research/experimentation time

### R2 Backup Discussion (16:25 UTC)
- Scott tried backup via Admin Console → got "source missing clawdbot.json" error
- I incorrectly said feature doesn't exist
- Scott reminded me we SET THIS UP YESTERDAY (but I have no record)

### Cost Optimization Research (14:50-16:33 UTC)
- Scott asked about multi-agent model selection for cost savings
- I researched: can save ~88% by using Haiku/Sonnet for routine tasks
- Created `memory/cost-optimization-research.md`
- **BLOCKED:** Scott correctly refused changes without proper backups

### Final Warning (16:36 UTC)
**Scott's ultimatum:** "3 days now... you need to figure out a lasting fix... If we can't get this working I will need to pull the plug"

## Action Items for THIS Session

### 1. Fix Memory System (PRIORITY 1)
- [x] Create this daily log
- [x] Search for any backup configs that DO exist
- [x] Document actual state vs. what we think exists
- [x] Create a cron job that FORCES daily log creation

### 2. Find What Actually Exists
- [x] rclone was NOT installed - installed it
- [x] No backup scripts existed - created one
- [x] Git was initialized but no commits - made initial commit

### 3. Create Failsafe
- [x] Added cron job `daily-memory-log` (23:55 UTC daily)
- [x] Added cron job `nightly-backup` (03:00 UTC daily)
- [x] Created `/root/backup-to-r2.sh` script
- [x] Git commit made with all workspace files

## What I Fixed (16:37 UTC)

### Installed & Configured
1. **rclone** - Installed v1.73.0
2. **rclone.conf** - Configured R2 endpoint (needs bucket created in Cloudflare dashboard)
3. **git** - Initial commit of workspace
4. **backup-to-r2.sh** - Automated backup script

### New Cron Jobs
1. **daily-memory-log** - 23:55 UTC - Forces daily log creation
2. **nightly-backup** - 03:00 UTC - Runs git + R2 backup script

### Remaining Issues
- **R2 bucket doesn't exist yet** - Need to create `clawdbot-backups` in Cloudflare dashboard
- **No GitHub remote** - Need repo URL from Scott to push to

## What Needs to Happen Next
1. Scott creates R2 bucket `clawdbot-backups` in Cloudflare dashboard
2. Scott provides GitHub repo URL for remote
3. Test backup script manually: `/root/backup-to-r2.sh`
4. Verify tomorrow's memory log gets created automatically

## Credentials Saved
- R2 Account ID: `5aa3e6d38bbc1aeda4942830577dfb8e`
- R2 Access Key: `483ee77def71a1377255d2867425b33e`
- R2 Secret: (saved in memory/credentials.md)

## Current Cron Jobs
1. innovation-hour (17:00 UTC daily)
2. nightly-self-improvement (04:00 UTC daily)
3. reddit-community-pulse (09:00 UTC daily)
4. daily-standup (10:30 UTC daily)
5. daily-research (14:00 UTC daily)

## Next Session: CHECK THESE FIRST
1. Read this file before doing ANYTHING
2. Read memory/credentials.md
3. Check for backup scripts in /root or ~/.clawdbot
4. Verify rclone status properly
5. Check git remotes in BOTH /root/clawd AND /root/.clawdbot
