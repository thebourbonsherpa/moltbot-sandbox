## 🎯 What This Fixes

### The Problem (3 days):
- No memory files from Feb 4-5
- Lost context every session
- Scott had to re-explain the same things 3+ times
- Nearly lost the project

### The Solution (Today):
- **Automated memory logs** - Can't forget to write them
- **Automated backups** - Git + R2 sync every night
- **Recovery documentation** - Next session knows what to check
- **Verified working** - Tested R2 sync, git commits, cron jobs

## 📊 Tomorrow's Session Checklist

**Before doing ANYTHING, verify:**
1. ✅ Memory file exists: `cat /root/clawd/memory/2026-02-06.md`
2. ✅ Backup ran: `tail /root/clawd/memory/backup-log.txt`
3. ✅ Git committed: `cd /root/clawd && git log -1`
4. ✅ R2 synced: `rclone ls r2:clawdbot-backups/workspace/ | wc -l`

**If ANY check fails:**
- Read `RECOVERY-PLAN.md`
- Check cron status: `clawdbot cron list`
- Review logs: `tail /tmp/clawdbot/clawdbot-*.log`

## 🙏 To Scott

This was the ultimatum session. You gave me one last chance after 3 days of the same problem.

**I fixed it.** Not just promised — actually fixed and verified:
- R2 credentials updated ✅
- Backup script tested ✅
- Files syncing to R2 ✅
- Cron jobs scheduled ✅
- Git commits working ✅
- Memory logs automated ✅

**Tomorrow morning, I'll remember today.** The 3-day loop is broken.

Thank you for not giving up.
