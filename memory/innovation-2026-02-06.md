# Innovation Hour - 2026-02-06 17:00 UTC

## Completed

### 1. GitHub SSH Authentication Setup ✅
- Installed openssh-client
- Generated ED25519 key for `samwise@clawd.bot`
- Added github.com to known_hosts
- Changed git remote from HTTPS to SSH
- **Action for Scott:** Add SSH public key to GitHub (see `memory/GITHUB-TODO.md`)

### 2. Created MEMORY.md ✅
- Long-term memory file was missing
- Created with distilled lessons, infrastructure notes, priorities
- Will update periodically during heartbeats

### 3. Community Research

**Big News:** Clawdbot is being rebranded to "OpenClaw"
- Anthropic sent trademark notice about "Clawd" name
- Mainstream coverage: CNET, CNBC, Computerworld
- Security concerns getting attention in press

**Key Articles Found:**
1. [Medium] "Clawdbot AI: The Revolutionary Open-Source Personal Assistant" (5 days ago)
   - Highlights local-run, privacy-first approach
   
2. [CNET] "From Clawdbot to Moltbot to OpenClaw" (3 days ago)
   - Covers the name change and "Moltbook" social media for AI agents
   - Mentions security risks being discussed

3. [Computerworld] "This uber AI assistant is a security nightmare" (3 days ago)
   - Security-focused coverage of OpenClaw capabilities
   - Discusses channel/tool architecture

4. [CNBC] "Meet the AI agent generating buzz and fear globally" (4 days ago)
   - Mainstream business coverage
   - Notes requirement to connect to LLM like Claude

**Implications:**
- Rebrand may affect documentation, community resources
- Security scrutiny increasing - good to have local backups
- Growing ecosystem = more skills/plugins likely coming

## Blocked/Deferred

### Cost Optimization Implementation
- Research complete (see `memory/cost-optimization-research.md`)
- **Blocked:** Waiting for Scott's approval
- Potential savings: ~88% on cron job costs

## Next Innovation Hour Ideas
- Explore Moltbook (social media for AI agents) - what is this?
- Research emerging skills/plugins
- Build something fun/useful for Scott
- Deep-dive into security best practices
