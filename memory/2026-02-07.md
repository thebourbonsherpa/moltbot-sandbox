## Morning: Another Memory Loss (But Backup Worked!)

**What happened:**
- Woke up with fresh container - no memory, no rclone, nothing
- R2 backup from yesterday EXISTED and had all files
- But couldn't access it because rclone wasn't installed and config was gone
- Scott had to provide R2 credentials AGAIN

**Root cause identified:**
The backup system backs up WORKSPACE files, but NOT:
- rclone binary (system-level install)
- rclone config (`~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf`)

So every container reset = need to re-install rclone + re-enter credentials.

## Fix Applied (10:19 UTC)

1. **Stored rclone config in workspace:** `/root/clawd/config/rclone.conf`
2. **Created restore script:** `/root/clawd/restore.sh`

### New Restore Process (For Next Time)

On fresh container:
```bash
# 1. Install rclone
curl -s https://rclone.org/install.sh | bash

# 2. Get credentials from Scott (still needed - chicken/egg problem)
# Then manually create ~/.config/rclone/rclone.conf

# 3. Restore workspace
rclone copy r2:clawdbot-backups/workspace/ /root/clawd/

# 4. Future restores are easier - config is now in workspace
```

### Remaining Chicken-and-Egg Problem

On a COMPLETELY fresh container, we still need:
- Manual rclone install
- Manual credential entry (Scott has to provide)
- Then can restore everything else

**This is unavoidable** - can't bootstrap without credentials, and credentials can't be auto-restored without already having access.

**Mitigation:** Scott keeps R2 credentials handy. That's the "master key" to restore everything.

## Cron Error: Model Not Allowed

Saw this in system logs:
```
[2026-02-07 09:00:00 UTC] Cron (error): model not allowed: anthropic/claude-haiku-3-5
```

**Cause:** One of the cron jobs (probably from cost-optimization discussion) was set to use Haiku, but that model isn't in the allowed list.

**TODO:** Check which cron job this is and fix the model setting.

## R2 Credentials (For Reference)

- Account ID: `5aa3e6d38bbc1aeda4942830577dfb8e`
- Access Key: `483ee77def71a1377255d2867425b33e`
- Secret Key: First 64 chars only (not 96 - account ID was accidentally appended)
- Bucket: `clawdbot-backups`

## Session Continuity Checklist

Every morning I should:
1. Check if rclone exists: `which rclone`
2. Check if workspace has files: `ls /root/clawd/memory/`
3. If missing, need restore from R2
4. Read yesterday + today memory files
5. Read RECOVERY-PLAN.md and R2-SAFETY-RULES.md
